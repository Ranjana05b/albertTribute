        <ul>
            <li> <b> Albert Einstein</b> was a German-born theoretical physicist</li>
            <li> He is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time.</li>
            <li>Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
                the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</li>
            <li>Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.</li>
            <li>His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the
                world's most famous equation".</li>
            <li>His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</li>
            <li> He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
                for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</li>
            <li> Photoelectric Effect is a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</li>
            <li> His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".
            </li>

            <li> In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four
                groundbreaking papers.</li>
            <li>These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special
                relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence.</li>
            <li> Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics
                could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his
                special
                theory of relativity.</li>
            <li>He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general
                relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation.</li>
            <li>In 1917, he applied the general theory of
                relativity to model the structure of the universe.</li>
            <li>He continued to deal with problems of statistical
                mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of
                molecules.</li>
            <Li>He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the
                foundation of the photon theory of light.</Li>
            <li>However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on
                two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors.</li>
            <li> First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he
                opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature "does not play dice".</li>
            <li>Second, he attempted to devise
                a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism.
                As a
                result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.</li>
            </ul>
